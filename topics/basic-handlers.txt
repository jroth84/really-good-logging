Basic Handlers
==============

Handlers take a log message and put it somewhere.

The default logging
handler you get with logging.basicConfig is the StreamHandler, which
sends stuff to stderr.

You can use the filename argument to send logs to a file instead::

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, filename='/tmp/out.log'))

Here's an example::

    $ python code/fun_with_handlers.py

    $ cat /tmp/out.log
    INFO:root:All done!

That log file is opened with append mode by default, so if you run the
script many times, your logs will just accumulate::

    $ python code/fun_with_handlers.py
    $ python code/fun_with_handlers.py
    $ python code/fun_with_handlers.py

    $ cat /tmp/out.log
    INFO:root:All done!
    INFO:root:All done!
    INFO:root:All done!
    INFO:root:All done!

You can set the mode to 'w' instead, and then each time you run your
program, you will overwrite the logs from the last run.

Later we'll talk about what to add to the log message so we can
distinguish the different scripts.

And we'll talk about how to rotate logs.
