Use a config file to set up logging
===================================

There are three ways that I know of to set up logging:

*   code (that's what I showed in code/beyond_basic_logging.py)
*   config file
*   dictionary

This program works just like code/beyond_basic_logging.py, but uses a
config file rather than a bunch of code::

    $ python rgl/code/logging_config_example.py

Loading a config file is stupid simple::

    import logging.config
    logging.config.fileConfig(path_to_config_file)

The logging config syntax is boring old ini-style.  Here's how to set up
the SMTPHandler


Sidebar on pkg_resources
------------------------

Forget about logging for a second.  Any program that uses config files
has to figure out where to put these files.

When you're developing, it isn't a problem to just explicitly hard-code
the path to the config file in your program.  You probably run your
program out of your source-control checkout.

But when you release this code and this config fiile as a package for
other people to install and use, you won't know how and where the code
is installed.

These are popular solutions:

*   Hard-code some path under /etc in your program and during the
    install, copy the config file to that path.

    *   This likely will require special permission.
    *   What if many people people (or virtualenvs) share a box?
    *   Uninstalling is not so easy now

*   Require library users to tell you where to find the config file.

    *   This is annoying to the end user.  When you import a python
        module, you don't have to explicitly say where it lives; why
        should you have to explicitly say where to find the config file
        for the module?

    *   With python eggs, this is not even possible, because eggs are
        installed as zipped-up packages.

Or you can use pkg_resources.

It lets you store stuff like configuration files, text files, images,
and lots of other stuff inside your code tree.

And later, no matter where your code is installed, you can access these
"resources".

Of course, with this approach, the end user can not customize these
configurations (just like they can't edit the code either) so if you
mean for the end user to use the config file to alter how stuff works,
then pkg_resources is not the right tool.
