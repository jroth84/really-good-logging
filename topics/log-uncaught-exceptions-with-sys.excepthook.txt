Log uncaught exceptions by setting sys.excepthook
=================================================

Uncaught exceptions will not be logged
--------------------------------------

This is a script that is going to blow up::

    $ cat kaboom1.py

    $ python kaboom1.py

The traceback does not show up in the output logs!

::

    $ cat /tmp/kaboom1.log


You could wrap your code with big try / except
----------------------------------------------

I don't like this:

*   easy to accidentally nest within another try/except.

*   easy to forget to re-raise exception, so the script may return a
    misleading error code

You should use sys.excepthook
-----------------------------

The kaboom2.py script does it right::

    $ cat kaboom2.py
