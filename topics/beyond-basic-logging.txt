Beyond basic logging
====================

My typical logging setup:

*   Write everything of DEBUG or greater to stderr and /tmp/rgl.log

*   Write everything with level INFO or greater to /var/log/rgl.log

*   Email critical log messages

*   Every log message has:

    *   date and time
    *   log level
    *   process ID
    *   line number of the log statement
    *   file name containing the log statement

WHERE ARE YOUR PRINT STATEMENTS NOW?
