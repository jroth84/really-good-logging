Basic Logging
=============

This script sets the logging level based on the argument you pass in.
Here's what you see when you set the log level to CRITICAL::

    $ python code/fun_with_levels.py CRITICAL
    CRITICAL:root:OH NO THIS IS CRITICAL

And at the opposite extreme, you can set the logging level to DEBUG::

    $ python code/fun_with_levels.py DEBUG
    DEBUG:root:This is a boring debug message.
    INFO:root:Here is an info message...
    WARNING:root:This is a warning message!
    ERROR:root:Even worse, This is an error message!
    CRITICAL:root:OH NO THIS IS CRITICAL
    INFO:root:All done!

These are the levels, sorted from lowest to highest level:

*   DEBUG
*   INFO
*   WARNING (aka WARN)
*   ERROR
*   CRITICAL (aka FATAL)

Here's all you have to do::

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    logging.debug('blargh')
