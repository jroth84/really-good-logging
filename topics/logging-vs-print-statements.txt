Logging vs Print Statements
===========================


What people expect from logging
-------------------------------

from http://www.quora.com/Why-do-logging-systems-become-so-complex::

    Logging systems are used to handle a number of slightly different use
    cases. The different uses of logging systems include:
    - Debugging logic errors during development
    - Debugging performance errors during development
    - Recording exceptional situations in production
    - Gathering performance metrics (how long did x take?)
    - Gathering application level statistics (how many x’s occurred?)
    - Postmortems and forensic analysis (What was happening before we
      crashed?)
    - Generating traces from user events in production (how are people using
      x?)
    - Getting events from many places to a single archival system
      (aggregation)
    - Send messages to other end points (I’m looking at you log4j/smtp
        appender)
    - Provide human and machine readable visibility into a system (app x
        has finished launching!)
