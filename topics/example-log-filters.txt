Fun with filters
================

Use different filters so that 404 errors go one place and 500 errors go
somewhere else.

*   In the filter, use text analysis on log messages, like::

        if "404" in message:
            return True

    This is ugly because 404 might be a part of some unrelated log
    message, like a user ID.


*   Use type-checking on the log objects in the filter, like::

        if isinstance(log, My404Exception):
            return True

    Much better!  Now I just need to log stuff like this::

        try:
            handle(req)
        except Exception as ex:
            log.exception(ex)
