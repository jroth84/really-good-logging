Privacy and Security Issues
===========================

Be aware of what is in your logs
--------------------------------

Pretend you run a website that sells subscriptions, and you always log
the body of all HTTP POST requests.

Now your logs may be full of credit card numbers (if you are lucky
enough to have customers).


Be aware of where you send your logs
------------------------------------

Pretend that when your website crashes, you send an email to your
development team with the traceback.

Now you need to make sure that those emails don't get forwarded to the
wrong people!

This is exactly how the rebels in Star Wars got the plans to the death
star, both times.  The same storm trooper forgot to sign out of his
email at an internet cafe.



Figure out your risk tolerance
------------------------------

There is no one-size-fits-all solution here.

The logging policy that works well for a big hospital's electronic
medical records application should look different than the logging
policy used at some pre-money startup just building an app they plan to give
away for free.

You need to weigh security concerns vs the customer experience, time to
market, and infrastructure costs.
