Really good logging
+++++++++++++++++++

Description
===========

Really good logging means when something goes wrong in the middle of the night,
you know about it, and you have enough information to fix it even if the
problem never repeats.

At the same time, really good logging doesn't raise false alarms and doesn't
require finding needles in a haystack.

Logging is important, but we usually do it wrong. Let's stop doing that.

Abstract
========

I aim to talk about how to:

*   get started with the python standard library logging module

    *   use-basic-logging.txt

*   use different handlers for different kinds of messages, so some messages go
    to text files and others go to emails, and some others go to both places.

    *   dispatch-by-log-level.txt

*   Set up non-trivial logging systems with config files, code, or
    dictionaries

    *   configure-logging-with-code.txt

*   record a stack trace with as much detail as you want (even if you want the
    values of every object in every frame)

    *   how-to-log-exceptions.txt

*   send logs from different boxes to a central box

    *   fun-with-syslog.txt
    *   in-process-vs-background.txt

*   security and privacy issues with logging

    *   privacy-and-security-issues.txt


*   rotate and archive old logs automatically.

    *   rotate-your-log-files.txt

*   do log analysis and search with more than ssh and grep




*   use logstash, graylog2, loggly.com and any other packages and services I
    find out about.

I'd love to get input from people about what is important to them.

Novice people should show up. Learn how to log and your life will be much more
meaningful.
