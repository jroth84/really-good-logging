Write code to represent a project with these parts:

*   web process
*   daily cron job
*   a bunch of long-lived background processes that consume data from a queue

Log these kinds of things:

*   noisy debug stuff
*   INFO-level stuff
*   404 errors
*   500 errors

Use different log levels to dispatch to different handlers.  Send
critical errors to email, debugs to stderr, info to text files.

Use different filters so that 404 errors go one place and 500 errors go
somewhere else.

Use logrotate to archive logs.

Use logstash to send log files offsite.


Configure syslog on one box to send logs to a different box.

Use logstash to send logs to graylog

Use logstash to transform logs
